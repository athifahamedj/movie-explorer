# React + Vite

using # React + Vite I've created the project,
To run the project, 
1) npm install command
2) cd to the project
3) npm run dev
4) to run test npm test



Short design notes:
1)used local storage for dark/light theme approach
2)used Jest for testing approach
3)API has 1000 links limitation
